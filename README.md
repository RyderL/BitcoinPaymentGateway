## Bitcoin Payment Gateway
"Bitcoin Payment Gateway" is a stand-alone payment gateway coded in Java using BitcoinJ. It doesn't need a running instance of bitcoind, it instead communicates directly with the P2P network and only requires a PostgreSQL to store the recent block headers.

As of November 15th, 2014, it is nowhere near complete. Feel free to fork.
