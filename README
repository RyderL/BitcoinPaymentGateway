##Bitcoin Payment Gateway
========================

BitcoinPaymentGateway is a stand-alone Bitcoin Payment Gateway coded in Java using BitcoinJ. It doesn't need a running instance of bitcoind, it instead communicates directly with the P2P network and only requires a PostgreSQL to store the recent block headers.
